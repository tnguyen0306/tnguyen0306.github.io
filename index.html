  <img src="image/pic.png" alt="Tyler Nguyen">

  <p>I was born and raised in Vietnam. I moved to The US in 2010. I graduated at University of Houston with a Bachelor's degree under Petroleum Engineering in May 2020. Since November 2018, I have been working at Ambyint Inc., a market leader in AI-powered optimization for the oil and gas industry.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Computers have been in my life ever since my reminiscing can recall. I feel thankful that I have exposed to this subject that early because computers are something which are not available to anyone in my hometown back in the day. My interest in it has grown every day that I would love to explore more. Therefore, I decided to attend the Data Vizualization Course at Rice University to expand my choices of work industries.</p>
